                                    These sweet, slightly bitter oranges are arguably the most common type of all. You’ll know a navel orange when you see one, thanks to its signature mark on the bottom that resembles a belly button. Because of their inviting flavor and lack of seeds, navel oranges are a great pick for snacking on raw or adding to salads.

Cara Cara oranges are famous for their low acidity and refreshing sweetness, which make them prime for snacks, raw dishes and juice. (They also tend to have minimal seeds.) Also called red-fleshed navel oranges. Their flesh has a deeper color due to natural carotenoid pigments.

They get their name from the deep red color of their flesh, which is super juicy, sweet and tart. Their flavor is unique, sort of like tart oranges mixed with plump, ripe raspberries. There are three main types—Moro, Sanguinello and Tarocco—which range from tart to sweet, respectively.

                                    These Mediterranean fruits are also called sour oranges for a reason. Seville oranges are minimally sweet and big on tartness and bitterness. This makes them the best choice for marmalade, as they can hold their own against and complement the substantial amount of sugar that needs to be added. The oranges and their peels are also great for flavoring marinades.

Common in South America and the Mediterranean, lima oranges are also known as acidless oranges because they’re super sweet with minimal acidity or tartness. They have thick peels and some seeds, but they’re great for snacking on raw nonetheless because of their soft, tender texture.

                                Oranges, and all citrus fruits, originated in the Southeast Himalayan foothills, in a region including the eastern area of Assam (India), northern Myanmar and western Yunnan (China). A fossil specimen from the late Miocene epoch (11.6 - 5.3 million years ago) from Lincang in Yunnan, China has traits that are characteristic of current major citrus groups, and provides evidence for the existence of a common Citrus ancestor within the Yunnan province approximately 8 million years ago. Not much is known about the orange in human context prior to 314, when the first written evidence of the fruit appeared out of China. Fast forward 400 years... the sour orange (mix of Type 1 Mandarin and Pomelo) was spread by Moors following the Islamic Conquest in the 8th century. At the time, the Arab empire stretched from the borders of China and the Indian subcontinent across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe (including Sicily and the Iberian Peninsula). The sour orange was not palatable, but was used widely by herbalists to make medicinal syrup. Among the earliest text-based evidence of the sour orange outside Southeast Asia is from 940. Golden Lawns by al-Mas'udi stated that the sour orange was brought to Oman after 912. By the turn of the 11th century, the sour orange had spread through the modern day Arab world to Persia, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain, and subsequently to Sardinia and Sicily in Italy. The word orange derives from a transliteration of the Sanskrit word for the orange tree: nāraṅga. Sanskirt is an ancient Indo-European classical language of South Asia. It is one of the twenty-two official languages of India. Its position in the cultures of South and Southeast Asia is akin to that of Latin and Greek in Europe and it has evolved into, as well as influenced, many modern languages of the world.
                                The Sanskirt word nāraṅga originates from Tamil, thought to be the longest surviving language. In Tamil, the word ārañcu translates to "6 and 5" implying 11. Oranges typically have 11 individual pieces and were named accordingly. Additionally, in Tamil, the root nurga translates to fragrant, suspected to be the origin of the 'n' at the beginning of the word in Sanskirt.
                                Before you go counting your orange pieces, I should probably mention that I have already done that. Out of the many, many oranges I counted the pieces of (sorry that is not a quantifiable number), mandarins had 10-12, and sweet oranges had 12-13. The oranges we eat today do not have the exact genetic make up as the ones the fruit was named for - but must be close!
                                Nāraṅga reached European languages through Persian (nārang) and Arabic (nāranj) variations of the term. The word ‘orange’ first appeared in the English language in the 12th century. It is thought to have come via the Old French word orenge. It is unclear if orenge derived directly from Persian or Arabic, or if it was calqued from the Italian word used for orange tree, arancio. What came first, the colour or the fruit? The fruit. Before the English-speaking world was exposed to the fruit, the colour was referred to as "yellow-red”, and saffron was sometimes used to describe the deep colour. This changed when orange trees were brought to Europe. The orange became widely available in the markets, and inspired the name for the colour. The first recorded use of 'orange' as a colour name in English was in the early 1500s.
